# Getting Started with Create React App

In the project directory, you can run the following commands after installation:

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `npm install`
=======
#### See the [README.md](https://github.com/crispycret/flask-react-starter/tree/main/backend) of the backend section regarding the flask application that serves as the data and control center of the frontend application.

Using default react README.md until documentation is written.

## Available Scripts
>>>>>>> origin

This will install the required frontend dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# Getting Started with the Flask Backend
In the `backend/` directory, you can run the application after doing a basic setup.

## Setup

### `pip install -r requrements.txt`

Installs all the backend dependencies required to run the server application.

### `flask run`

Will start the server application.

## Database Setup (optional)

### Preloaded (default)

The project repository includes a backend database preloaded with the data required to allow a full demo of the application.

### Reset

If you wish to reset the database and start with no data then it is necessary to do the following from the `backend/` direcotry:

##### `rm -rf migrations && default.db`

Will remove the migrations folder and the sqlite database which is generated by `flask-sqlalchemy`

#### `flask db init`

Will create the new database.

#### `flask db migrate`

Allow `flask-sqlalchemy` to make changes to the database using the database models in the application.

#### `flask db upgrade`

Commit these changes to the database.
